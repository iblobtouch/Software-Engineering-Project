Code coverage is used and an attempt to test all parts of the code has been made.
The Main and Editor class will not be part of this coverage because they are Front End classes 
and are therefore outside the test scope. Additionally, script barfed in the ScriptCommand class which is triggered after
a readline from a BufferedReader causes an IOException was also not tested. 
This was because they are difficult to simulate in the test environment as they are caused by external factors
that cannot be easily simulated e.g. the sudden deletion of a source file being used in the test.

In Resources, getFinished() is only ever used in the front end to check whether the application is ready to terminate
which explains why it also wasn't covered in the test coverage.
