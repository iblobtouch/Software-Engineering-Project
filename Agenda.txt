Stuff to change:
Improvements document needs to be split (Sohail)-
-Critiques.pdf critiques the current system, containing bullet points with a brief description of why it's bad.
-Improvements.pdf reports on changes made, containing brief points on the changes made, how they improved the project overall.

New additions:
-Test cases, adequate for testing the system + evidence of good unit test coverage in improvements.pdf (Nick).
-Undo command, revert filters applied (Nick).
-Image cache, with commands to put images in it and get them back, storing the filters applied with each one. (Gerron)
-Javadocs documentation, providing good documentation on how the code/project overall works. (Gerron)
-Static analysis report filled out. (Sohail)
-Full commit logs in improvements.pdf (Meaningful commit name/descriptions to)
Everyone needs to commit.
